How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The key to maintain a well organized program is to make notes throughout to easily track your progress. This made it easy to make corrections and test section by section to reduce errors. Using crude made it easier to use a step by step process to complete the 
project by focusing on one aspect at a time.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I tried to approach each problem by dividing it into sections like the CRUD process being create, read, update, and delete. This made it easier to understand and meet the needs of the clients when creating their database.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

A computer scientist uses their skills in programming to help either their own or other companies by creating programs that make make daily tasks easier. This project creates an easier database for the company to easily locate, delete, and update files.
